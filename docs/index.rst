Astrogrism is a data analysis package for analyzing astronomical 
grism data for Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) observations being 
built from the ground up. The project's goal is to bring together 
Hubble and James Webb Space Telescope grism reduction pipelines 
and analysis functions into a unified ecosystem. Currently, the 
Astrogrism makes the geometric transform framework used by JWST
available for use with the HST WFC3 IR and UVIS grisms, as well 
as the HST ACS grism.
